	/*
	** Example implementation of an HMM.
	** Converted from hmm-foods.c by Adam Hoover
	** Uses a probability density function for observables, meaning the
	** observed values are continuous.
	** The number of states and the number of observable (PMF) values
	** define the scale of the problem.
	** The initial, transmission probabilities are
	** given and hardcoded.
	** The emission probabilities are represented as means and variances.
	** We do not use covariances in this example.
	** The input is a sequence of observed values.
	** Viterbi decoding (forward algorithm then backward algorithm)
	** is used to determine the most likely sequence of states that
	** produced the input sequence of observed values.
	** Calculates probabilities using raw p and log(p), the latter
	** of which is necessary for numerical stability of long sequences.
